                  <h2 class="blog-post-title"><em>What is japanese streetfashion?</em></h2>
                  <p class="blog-post-meta">When and what inspired it?</p>
      
                  <p><strong>Tokyo Street Fashion has a long history, stemming from the youth protest against the Vietnam War in the 60s. Nowadays, fashion in Japan highlights the importance of self-expression in a country with very restricting traditions.</strong></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Japanese street fashion refers to a number of styles of contemporary modern clothing in Japan. Created from a mix of both <em>local</em> and <em>foreign</em> fashion brands, Japanese street fashions tend to have their own distinctive style, with some considered to be <em>extreme</em> and <em>avant-garde</em>, with similarities to the haute couture styles seen on European catwalks.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Though extremely popular in the <em>1990s</em> and <em>early 2000s</em>, many trends experienced a downturn in popularity in the later 2000s and onwards; the rise and fall of many of these trends had been chronicled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoichi_Aoki">Shoichi Aoki</a> since 1997 in the fashion magazine <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fruitsmag/?hl=el"><em>Fruits</em></a>, which was a notable magazine for the promotion of street fashion in Japan.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <h2>More about Fruits:</h2>
                  <p>The city has long been known for its expressive and cartoonish styles, and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku"><em>Harajuku</em></a> district as the gathering place for the most flamboyant and eclectic youth tribes of all. This cradle of sartorial eccentricity, full of fabulously inventive teen subgroups, boomed in the 1990s. And it was immortalised in monthly print magazine <em>FRUiTS</em>, a bible of innovative, outrageous personal style, created and published by the much-revered Aoki.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                      <p>The magazine was <strong>ground-breaking</strong> and <strong>influential</strong>, in both fashion and photography. Japanese teen tribes in all their style-conscious variety and dizzying complexity could be found in the pages of FRUiTS. From the girly Dolly Kei and Lolita to Gyaru, Decora and Ura-Hara, along with proponents of all things <em>kawaii</em> (cute), each tribe came with its own highly specific and inventive dress codes, concepts and rituals.</p>
                      </blockquote>
                  <h2>The different styles:</h2>
                  <h3>Lolita</h3>
                  <p><strong>Across the Pacific Ocean, "lolita" has come to mean something vastly different. Born out of Japanese street style culture in the 70s, Lolita fashion is intricate, layered, and visually modest</strong></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Lolita fashion reached its most popular heights back in the early to mid-2000s through the crossover medium of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei">"visual kei"</a> bands, which brought with them a melange of <em>gothic, aristocratic, and heavy metal aesthetic</em> influences—Gothic Lolita style, which has a more macabre focus than traditional Lolita looks.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                      <p>Lolita Fashion has a surprisingly long history.
                        Despite the change that has occurred since Lolita’s frst appearance in the late 1970s, certain
                        elements remain intact:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The clothes must draw inspiration from a time period and place that is
                                <strong>modern Japan</strong></li>
                                <li> They must be high-quality
                                    <strong>(not costume-like)</strong></li>
                                    <li>They must emphasize
                                        the <em>innocence, vulnerability, sweetness or – in
                                        other words – cuteness</em> of the wearer</li>
                        </ul> 
                        One thing
                        can be said with certainty: if it is not cute, <strong>it is
                        not</strong> Lolita. </p>
                  </blockquote>
                 <h3>Decora</h3>
                 <p><strong>One of the most unique street fashion styles in Japan is called Decora. The name “Decora” comes from the word “decoration,” and like most street fashion styles, it is now considered as one of Japan’s subcultures.</strong></p>
                 <hr>
                  <p>Decora is a <em>playful and child-like</em> style. It has less of a silhouette and is more focused on the use of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accessories</li>
                        <li>Motifs</li>
                        <li>Color schemes</li>
                    </ul>
                 Shades of <em>pink and blue</em> are very popular, as well as pastels. Neon colors are also greatly used. Colors are also often used in abundance, with multi-colored or rainbow themes being popular.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The first rule is to have <strong>as many accessories as possible</strong>. In fact, there is no such thing as too many accessories in decora! Accessories should also be cute as well as numerous. Popular hairstyles for women tend to be <em>pigtails, braids, or curls</em>. These add to the "cute" aspect of the outfit. For men, <em>longer hairstyles</em> are more popular as well.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h3>Mode</h3>
                    <p><strong>As the most high-fashion set on the list, you will find these guys dressed in nothing less than the best. Label names are important to this group. The style is similar is more flamboyant and they aim for higher price point brands like Dior Homme and Prada. You can find these guys reading publications like gap Press Men, men’s FUDGE, Vogue Hommes Japan.</strong></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>This style loses the shape of garments and limits the color pallet.  Brands like Comme des garçon and Yohji Yamamoto regularly use elements from the Mode style in their runway and ready to wear collections.  Before America turned A la Mode into a term used for ice cream topped pie, it simply meant “in fashion”. This style blends in, to stand out. Muting your wardrobe and straying from flashy colors sends off a message that you don’t want to be seen.  However, <em>creating abstract shapes with your body</em> that are nothing short of striking shout “notice me!”</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Mode is also known for the many dark colored layers of clothes but still staying <em>chic and comfortable</em>. Lastly one known <em>japanese designer</em>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohji_Yamamoto">Yohji Yamamoto</a>, was deeply inspired by the mode streetfashion and desided to open his own shop with Mode clothing pieces with his signature. The shop is called Y and its one of the most popular shops in the Harajuku district in Japan!</p>
